# React Credit Card Information App

Welcome to the React Credit Card Information App! This application allows users to input their credit card information, including the card number, expiry date, and CVV. As the user types in the card number field, the application determines the card type (e.g., Visa, Mastercard) and displays a sample image of the card with flip animations. Additionally, the app utilizes React-Toastify for displaying toast messages and SCSS for styling. You can run the app online by visiting [Credit Card](https://webofdeva-creditcard.netlify.app/).
